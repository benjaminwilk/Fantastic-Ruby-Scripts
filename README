Title: Fantastic Ruby Scripts
Last Edit: December 11th, 2013

A variety of scripts written by me, their reason for creation to make the position of system monitoring a bit easier. 

BoilerPlate.txt - Not actually a script; A change log of the Common Library loader that I wrote.  Includes original version and all the fixes I've come up with.    

HttpdandVhost.rb - Changes some settings in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file to optimal settings, along with lowering the maxclients setting to an appropriate level, also creates dummy vhost file so monitoring service won't complain.
vhost.txt - Rider for HttpdandVhost.rb

DomainChecker.rb - Grabs all the domain names on the server, prints their name, their allocated IP address, and their actual IP address in use.  

RebootFinderV2.rb - Collects pertinent information from server.  Includes last reboots, disk usage, disk health, sar records, dmesg & messages logs and a few other things.  These records are placed in a text document.  

EpochTime.rb - Converts time stamps from user's bash history and provides it in a text file.   

TrafficAnalyzer.rb - A variety of useful commands that checks server visits.  Just check it out, it's main menu tells you what it can do.  

LogExtractor.rb - Finds archived transfer logs, unzips them, compiles them, and allows user to view past users.   

SysWatch.rb - Doesn't totally work; runs on a server, with time setting parameter and email address, checks memory usage, server load, mysql logging, and if over a certain threshold, will email user. 

DatabaseRepair.rb - I don't think this one works either; Automated process that logs into MySQL and fixes the broken tables in the user-defined database.  

CommonLib.rb - A Common Library of frequently used functions.  

Experimental Folder -- Rather than making changes to working files, these scripts in are in the testing phase.  These files ere still being worked on and will be pushed out eventually.
